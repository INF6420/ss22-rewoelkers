# Rachel Woelkers' INF 6420  Project
A portfolio site showcasing my work.
## Wireframes
<h1> In order to plan out my website, here is my first sketch of a wireframe. </h1>

<p> <img src="Wireframes 1.jpeg" /> </p>

<p> Header - The Header will contain the introduction to my website. </p>
<p> Main Content - The Main Content will explain what the website is about. </p>
<p> Navigation Menu - The Navigation Menu will allow readers to move to other parts of the website. </p>
<p> Footer - The Footer will include contact information for the website. </p>

I will be creating a website for my classroom, hopefully to use next year. I will have multiple pages. The first wireframe is the idea for the main page. The second wireframe would include general updates, important dates, and our class photo link. The third would be the start for subjects, so probably about math. Including what we are working on, upcoming test dates, and helpful websites.
