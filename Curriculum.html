    <ul>
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> LOCS uses Math Expressions. Students will be expected to work in their workbook each day during our lessons. When done, they will complete their Math lesson Homework and Remembering. Students will take Quick Quizzes, Unit Tests, and Common Assessments to check their understanding. </li>
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> LOCS follows Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. We have various different units including Fantasy Book Clubs and Historical Fiction Book Clubs. Students will be expected to grow their reading stamina throughout the school year. There will also be passages they read and answer questions to assess their comprehension of the text.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing:</strong>LOCS follows Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. We have various units, but we are always teaching the same types of writing: Argument, Informational, and Narrative. Students will work on these types of writing all throughout the year. Their stamina will be expected to reach 30 minutes, which feels much longer when you are hand-writing! </li>
        <li><strong>Social Studies:</strong> LOCS uses TCI to teach Social Studies. It is an online site so students access their materials on their school computer. We will read the sections together, they will read it on their own, there will be various assignments and projects to learn the material, and at the end they will take a test.</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong>LOCS uses science kits that are delivered and we teach science from those! This year we will have a Science Coach to help make science even more meaningful and fun!</li>
        <li><strong>Grammar/ Word Study:</strong>LOCS uses Patterns of Power to teach grammar and they will be short lessons. For word study, I will give students a list of words they will work to spell and learn the spelling patterns.</li>
